# Apple Stock Price Prediction Models
# Project Overview
This project explores the application of several machine learning and deep learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to predict stock prices. By analyzing historical data, the project aims to forecast future stock trends, providing valuable insights for investment strategies.

# Models Used
#### Linear Regression: 
To establish a baseline for stock price prediction based on historical data.
#### Random Forest: 
To capture non-linear relationships in the data for more accurate predictions.
#### LSTM: 
To leverage sequential data for predicting future stock prices, considering time dependencies.

# Dataset
The dataset comprises historical stock prices, including open, high, low, close, and volume data, sourced from yfinance library. The analysis focuses on predicting the adjusted close prices for stocks over a specified period.

# Installation
To run this project, you will need Python 3.6+ and the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
tensorflow
matplotlib
yfinance for downloading stock data

# Clone this repository to your local machine:
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/rsm-rkalkundre/Apple-stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction

# Usage
To execute the model training and prediction scripts, navigate to the project directory and run:
Copy code
python stock_prediction.py

# Results
The models were evaluated based on their mean squared error (MSE) and accuracy in predicting future stock prices. The LSTM model showed superior performance, capturing the time-series nature of stock price movements effectively.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning and deep learning models in forecasting stock prices. The insights gained can aid in developing informed investment strategies, highlighting the importance of advanced analytical techniques in financial decision-making.
